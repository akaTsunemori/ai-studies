# AI Studies
A record of my studies on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial 
Intelligence in general.

The primary aim of maintaining this repository is to track my progress, reflect 
on my learning curve, and share my studies with the community. I hope to inspire
fellow programmers to embark on their Data Science journeys and provide a 
resource for those seeking knowledge or verification of their approaches.

I intend to update this repository as I organize more studies that can be made
public. As each project needs to have its own notebook with some theory and
the step-by-step process, this can take some time.

## Project Structure
Each folder contains a different project, each project contains its own Jupyter
notebook with details about the project, theory and code.

## Setup
It's recommended to use anaconda3, micromamba or any other Python environment 
management system. You can setup the environment by running
`conda env create -f environment.yml` and you're good to go. This environment
should be enough to run all the projects in this repository.

## Acknowledgements
- Some of the notebooks in this repository were based on the 
[Supervised Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
course by Coursera;
- Some of the notebooks were based on classes I took at the University of
BrasÃ­lia, thank you Paulo Henrique Portela de Carvalho for the excellent work;

## Additional information
Some of the projects were originally written in portuguese (as per 
external requirements), but were later translated to english by me. Moreover, 
some of the code is not perfect, but keep in mind this repository is a work 
in progress.
